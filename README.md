# Vax_Man_Game_Python.3

This is my personal Python version of the Vax-man game, and that is the first challenge of the EA Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program.

Pac-Man is one of the first computer games ever created. We're going to pay tribute to Pac-Man in this challenge.

We're working on a new game named Vax-Man. With a few noteworthy exceptions, the rules are similar to Pac-Man:

<ul>
  <li>Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it). </li>
  <li>Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.</li>
  <li>Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).</li>
  <li>The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.</li>
</ul>

<b>Dependencies</b>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>Pygame 1.4 or above </li>
</ul>
To <b>play</b>, run pacman_game.py and use directional arrows to move.
